# Nim: parallelized MinMax

This repo contains the project developed for the final exam of the GPU Programming master's course at Politecnico di Torino.

The aim is to create a parallel version of the minmax algorithm, developed during the [Computational Intelligence](https://github.com/squillero/computational-intelligence) course; the [original implementation](https://github.com/francescofiorella/computational_intelligence_2022_2023/tree/main/lab3) of the algorithm was written in Python, and has been adapted to CUDA/C++ in an iterative form (instead of a recursive).

The project is meant to be run on the Nvidia Jetson Nano; however it can be easily adapted to any kind of GPU.<br>
A quick presentation of the project can be found in the [abstract](https://github.com/francescofiorella/nim_jetson_nano_minmax/blob/main/abstract.pdf).
